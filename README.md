# Any SWF file 

# How To Setup
In your console/Shell, type "git clone https://github.com/oHeckGage/bloonstd5" (no quotes) and then wait for the clone to happen. Then, deploy it to whatever host you use such as Heroku or Railway or a separate VPS.


# NOTE:
**PLEASE NOTE:** THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR A LONG TIME. RUFFLE DOES NOT SUPPORT FLASH AS3 (ACTIONSCRIPT 3) AND WILL NOT FOR A WHILE. MOST GAMES MADE AFTER 2006 WERE MADE WITH AS3, AND RUFFLE ONLY SUPPORTS AS1 AND 2.
This flash game WILL work on the official Flash player however.
